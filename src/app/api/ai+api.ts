## Equipment Required

- Barbell
- Flat bench
- Weight plates (optional, based on your fitness level)
- Spotter (recommended for safety)

## Instructions

1. **Setup**
   Lie down on a flat bench with your back flat and feet planted firmly on the ground. Ensure your head, shoulders, and buttocks are in contact with the bench.

2. **Grip the Barbell**
   Grasp the barbell with both hands slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Your palms should be facing forward.

3. **Position the Barbell**
   Lift the barbell off the rack and position it directly above your chest with your arms fully extended. This is your starting position.

4. **Lower the Barbell**
   Slowly lower the barbell toward your chest while keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle from your body. Inhale as you lower the bar.

5. **Press the Barbell**
   Press the barbell back up to the starting position, exhaling as you do so. Ensure your movements are controlled.

6. **Repeat**
   Perform the desired number of repetitions, usually 8â€“12 for beginners.

## Tips

- Start with a lighter weight to focus on form before adding heavier weights.
- Keep your core engaged to stabilize your body throughout the movement.
- Keep your wrists straight and avoid excessive arching of your back.

## Variations

- **Dumbbell Bench Press**: Use dumbbells instead of a barbell for greater range of motion.
- **Incline Bench Press**: Adjust the bench to a 30â€“45Â° angle to target the upper chest.

## Safety

- Always use a spotter if lifting heavy weights.
- Keep your feet flat on the ground at all times.
- Do not lower the barbell too quickly â€” maintain control throughout the movement.
